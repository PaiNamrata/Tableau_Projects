I have created an interactive dashboard for analyzing a Superstore's performance.
The dashboard seamlessly integrates and joins two tables, ensuring a smooth data model. 
To extract meaningful insights, I created calculated measures that provide valuable metrics and enable dynamic filtering for Year and Region.
Additionally, Iâ€™ve implemented a parameter that allows users to choose data for various measures, including Sales, Profit, Orders, and Quantity. 
For an at-a-glance overview,
I designed three KPI cards to provide insights on Sales, Profit Margin, and Return Rate.
The dashboard features a variety of custom visualizations such as Bar Charts, Donut Charts, Pie Charts, Line Charts, Maps, and Tables. 
An action filter is also integrated: when a user selects a bar in the Sales by Category chart, all KPIs and sheet values automatically update to reflect the selected data.
Furthermore, I included an image of my GitHub profile, which is clickable and redirects users to my GitHub account.
This dashboard allows for tracking sales trends, understanding customer behavior, and evaluating product performance, empowering data-driven decision-making.
